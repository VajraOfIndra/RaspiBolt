# Bonus guide: Charge-lnd

*Difficulty: simple*

[Charge-lnd](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd) is a simple policy based fee manager for LND.

*Requirements:*

* LND (or LND as part of Lightning Terminal/litd)

*Acknowledgments:*

* This guide is modified from the [manual install guide](https://gist.github.com/openoms/823f99d1ab6e1d53285e489f7ba38602) for the Raspiblitz by @openoms.

## Install charge-lnd

* As recommended in the [repo](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installation), we don't need to have full admin rights to use charge-lnd. The following access rights are used:
    ** `offchain:read`
    ** `offchain:write`
    ** `onchain:read`
    ** `info:read`
We can create a suitably limited macaroon by issuing
  
  ```sh
  $ lncli bakemacaroon offchain:read offchain:write onchain:read info:read --save_to=~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/charge-lnd.macaroon
  ```
  
* We create a charge-lnd user, make it part of the bitcoin group (to be able to interact with LND)  

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser charge-lnd
  $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod --append --groups bitcoin charge-lnd
  ```
  
* As charge-lnd user, clone the charge-lnd repository, enter the charge-lnd directory and install the program and required packages using pip3 (don't forget the dot at the end of the pip command!)
  ```sh
  $ sudo su - charge-lnd
  $ git clone https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd.git
  $ cd charge-lnd
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt .
  ```

* Test of the installation was successful by running the program with the --help (or -h) flag

```sh
~/.local/bin/charge-lnd -h
>usage: charge-lnd [-h] [--lnddir LNDDIR] [--grpc GRPC]
>                  [--electrum-server ELECTRUM_SERVER] [--dry-run] [--check]
>                  [-v] -c CONFIG
>
>optional arguments:
>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
>  --lnddir LNDDIR       (default ~/.lnd) lnd directory
>  --grpc GRPC           (default localhost:10009) lnd gRPC endpoint
>  --electrum-server ELECTRUM_SERVER
>                        (optional, no default) electrum server host:port .
>                        Needed for onchain_fee.
>  --dry-run             Do not perform actions (for testing), print what we
>                        would do to stdout
>  --check               Do not perform actions, only check config file for
>                        valid syntax
>  -v, --verbose         Be more verbose
>  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
>                        path to config file
```

* We are going to create a simlink to the LND directory.
We'll place the link in the home directory of the charge-lnd user to match the default LND directory used by charge-lnd (~/.lnd) 
```sh
$ ln -s /mnt/ext/lnd/ /home/charge-lnd/.lnd
```

## Configuration file

* Create a configuration file that we will call charge-lnd.config
```sh
$ nano charge-lnd.config
```

* For this example, we will use a policy that 1) defines some default parameters; 2) then starts by looking at channels with very low outbound (below 200,000 sats) to apply a very large base fee that will prevent any attempted forward through the channel (and therefore avoid failures); then 3) ignores some channels that we want to deal with manually (e.g. a large liquidity sink); and 4) applies a proportional fee rate between 50 and 200 ppm (based on balance ratio) for the remaining channels.
* Do change the policy in accordance with your own strategy and needs! All the options are listed and described [here](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd)
```ini
# place holder for your defaults for your fee policies
# no strategy, so this only sets some defaults
[mydefaults]
min_fee_ppm_delta = 20
min_htlc_msat = 1000
max_htlc_msat_ratio = 1
time_lock_delta = 40

# 9999BaseFee should be evaluated first before other fees are set
# if local balance is <200,000 sats, increase fees very high
[1-#9999BaseFee_avoid_failed_forwards]
chan.max_local_balance = 200000
strategy = static
base_fee_msat = 9999000

# Ignore some channels
[2-ignore_two_channels]
node.id = <node_pubkey_1>,
	<node_pubkey_2>
strategy = ignore

# Proportional strategy for all other channels
[3-proportional_for_remaining_channels]
strategy = proportional
base_fee_msat = 0
min_fee_ppm = 50
max_fee_ppm = 200
```
* We can first test if the syntax is correct or if it contains some errors using the --check option.
We also have to indicate where the config file is located using the --config (or -c) option

```sh
$  ~/.local/bin/charge-lnd -c ~/charge-lnd/charge-lnd.config --check
> Configuration file is valid
```

* Then we can do a dry-run test which will print out what changes the program would apply of it was to be run.
A small report will be displayed for each channel policy that should be updated.
Adding the --verbose (or -v) option would add aditional information such as if the channel is enabled or disabled.
```sh
$  ~/.local/bin/charge-lnd -c ~/charge-lnd/charge-lnd.config --dry-run
> 700435x675x2  [<noda_alias>|<node_pukkey>]
>  policy:          1-stop_routing
>  strategy:        static
>  base_fee_msat:   0 âžœ 9999000
>  min_htlc_msat:   1000
>  max_htlc_msat:   1000000000
>  time_lock_delta: 40
>  ...
```

* Check each channel to see if the proposed updates are the intended one.
If not, amend the charge-lnd config and re-do dry-run tests until you arrive to the desired results

* Once we are happy with our fee policy and logic, we can manually apply it to our node by running the same command but without the --dry-run test.
Then exit the charge-lnd user.
```sh
$  ~/.local/bin/charge-lnd -c ~/charge-lnd/charge-lnd.config
$ exit
```

* Double-check the fee policy on all your channels to ensure that you are happy with the changes!

## Automatic fee updates

We can make the script run automatically at regular time intervals by using a cron job. For example, we could run the charge-lnd program every day at the 21st minute of every hour.

* We the admin user, create and edit (option -e) the crontab file of the charge-lnd user (option -u). 
If asked, select the /bin/nano text editor (type 1 and enter)
```sh
$ sudo crontab -u charge-lnd -e
```

* At the end of the file, paste the following lines. Then save (Ctrl+o) and exit (Ctrl+x)
```ini
# Run charge-lnd every four hours, every day; and log the updates in the /tmp/charge-lnd.log log file
21 */4 * * * /home/charge-lnd/.local/bin/charge-lnd -c /home/charge-lnd/charge-lnd/charge-lnd.config > /tmp/charge-lnd.log 2>&1; date >> /tmp/charge-lnd.log
```
* The stars and numbers at the start defines the interval at which the job will be run. You can double-check it by using this online tool: [https://crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/#21_*/4_*_*_*)
* `/home/umbrel/.local/bin/charge-lnd -c /home/umbrel/charge-lnd/myconfig` is the command to be run and where to find it (its path) together with the required option(s) (here the location of the configuration file)
* `> /tmp/charge-lnd.log 2>&1; date >> /tmp/charge-lnd.log` records the updates in a charge-lnd.log log file, including the Standard Error and Standard Out and with a timestamp

## Checking the logs

If you need to check the log files

* Use less to read the entire log file. Type g to go the start, G to the end, use the arrows to move up and down and exit by pressing q.
You can search for a specific string by typing ? followed by the string to be searched (e.g. a node alias) and then press enter.
```sh
$ less /tmp/charge-lnd.log
```

* To look for updates of a specific channel
```sh
$ cat /tmp/charge-lnd.log | grep -A 7 <node_alias>
```

# Upgrade

* Let's check what is the latest available version at [https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd/releases](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd/releases) and let's find what version of charge-lnd we are running
```sh
$ sudo su - charge-lnd
$ pip3 show charge-lnd
> Name: charge-lnd
> Version: 0.2.4
```

* If a newer version exists
```sh
$ pip3 install --upgrade charge-lnd
```

# Uninstall

If you want to uninstall charge-lnd:

* With the root user, delete the charge-lnd user
```sh
$ userdel -r charge-lnd
```
